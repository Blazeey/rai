# RAI

-   The RAI client is an executable downloaded by the students and runs on the students' machines. The executable requires no library dependencies and works on all the main operating systems and CPU architectures. Both features reduce the likelihood that students will have technical difficulties running the client. Users use the RAI client to interact with a distributed elastic system to submit jobs.
